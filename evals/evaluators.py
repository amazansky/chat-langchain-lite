"""Evaluators for the Chat LangChain Lite demo.

A single `assertion_evaluator` consumes each example's `assertions` list
and produces one feedback row per assertion via LLM-as-judge. This matches
the format Engine emits when proposing generated examples to a dataset,
so anything Engine adds is scored the same way.
